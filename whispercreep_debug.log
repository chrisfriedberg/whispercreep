[2025-05-11 03:16:53] over. Okay, so we have this Miro board that we've talked about before. I'll go over it fairly quickly
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] again, but we can get any data from for a provider practice through any one of four different
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] what we call data delivery methods. There is a vendor hosted SFTP where we can just connect to
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] that SFTP and pull files from a specific folder. That's this scenario too. There is also a scenario
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] that's fairly rare now where the vendor hosts an SFTP server, but they put files into semi-random
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] subfolders. It just so happens that mirth has some difficulty. Mirth doesn't really have a good way
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] of looping through multiple subfolders on an external SFTP server. In order to collect claims,
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] we have a couple of vendors that send data that way. The DevOps team just set up a run deck job
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] to log into those SFTP accounts and loop through the subfolders and pull the files over for us.
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] For those, these bypass mirth completely and go directly into a folder in Aladay.Lake called
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] run deck SFTP. For everything else, either mirth is logging into a vendor's SFTP and pulling files,
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] or the vendor is sending files to our SFTP down here. That can either be the traditional

[2025-05-11 03:16:53] SFTP server which is on mirth or SFTP or it is also possible for them to send via a TCP port.

[2025-05-11 03:16:53] [PROGRESS] Transcription progress: 40%
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] Yes Doug? What is the advanced MD? Is that a certain vendor that we...
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] It's advanced MD. Advanced MD is the vendor that insists on providing us claims in multiple
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] subfolders. They don't organize their SFTP folders the way that mirth can handle it.
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] Is that like an EMR or something? Is it a company? Yeah, I think you're right. I think it's a bar.
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] I used to work with them a long time ago. What is that? I'm sorry, I couldn't understand.
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] Value added resellers or bar? VAR. VAR. Okay, thank you. Yeah, we have a lot of value added
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] resellers who are not the vendor of the EHR. They're not the vendor of the practice management
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] system. They're another entity that provides interfaces on behalf of the practice from their
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] systems. They're like data broker basically? They're more like an interface consultant.
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] Okay. So they maintain interfaces. So instead of all scripts sending us data directly from their
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] system, a third party connects to all scripts, pulls the data, and sends it to us. And that's
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] what they are. Okay, thank you. So anyway, most of the time when you're dealing with claims,
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] A37s, and this is only A37s, we're not talking at this point about HealthChump. So HealthChump goes
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] to a different process, although the last couple steps of ingestion are the same. But when you're
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] dealing with A37s, either like up here, the vendor is providing A37s via their own SFTP server,
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] or down here they're sending to our SFTP server, or it is possible for them to send over at TCP port.
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] When the A37s are sent to our old SFTP server, they don't go through MRF either. Okay, they go
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] through a cron job that DevOps has set up, and they get copied to the associated SFTP server,
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] the associated SFTP folder in Aladde.leg in S3. Okay. The new SFTP server, SFTP Go, it actually
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] writes all of its files to a different S3 bucket called Aladde.sftp.prod. Mirth picks up files from
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] there and moves them to an SFTP folder in Aladde.leg. Okay. Now the goal of all of this is just to get

[2025-05-11 03:16:53] [PROGRESS] Transcription progress: 50%
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] the A37 into Aladde.leg. Because once the A37 files in Aladde.leg, a process called ET pipeline

[2025-05-11 03:16:53] [PROGRESS] Transcription progress: 50%
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] picks the files up because S3 sends it an SQS message saying, hi, I've got a new file. ET pipeline
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] looks at that and all ET pipeline does, sorry, I'm trying to move over here. All ET pipeline does
[2025-05-11 03:16:53] is write a record to the source data table in db.claims and attribution prod. DB claims and
