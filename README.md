# WhisperCreep  
### Video & Audio Transcription & Monitor App (Paranoid Edition)

**WhisperCreep** is a Windows-first Python app that lets you:
- Transcribe video files into timestamped text using OpenAI's Whisper.
- Extract audio from videos (MP3 format).
- Transcribe audio-only files.
- Monitor a folder for incoming video files and auto-transcribe them.
- Pause when manual transcription is running.
- Robust file handling with retry logic, permissions checks, file lock detection, and paranoid logging.

## üõ† Features  
- GUI built with PySide6 ‚Äî no CLI.
- Supports video and audio inputs (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.wmv`, `.mkv`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`).
- Uses `ffmpeg` for audio extraction.
- Uses OpenAI Whisper (`tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large` models).
- System Tray integration with minimize, resume, kill options.
- Monitors folders and safely queues files.
- Paranoid-level logging to per-run logs and system logs.
- Handles network shares, checks file locks, permissions, and stability before touching files.
- Uses temp files and only writes the final output if the transcription succeeds.

## üíæ Requirements  
- Windows 10 or higher  
- Python 3.10+  
- Installed libraries:
  - `whisper`
  - `torch`
  - `PySide6`
  - `ffmpeg` (must be installed and in your PATH)
  - `pywin32`
  - `shutil`, `tempfile`, `logging` (standard Python modules)

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Manual Mode (GUI)
- Launch the app.
- Select an operation (Video Transcript, Rip Audio, Audio Transcript).
- Select your source file.
- Click **Run**.
- The result will appear in your Downloads folder with a timestamp.

### 2. Monitor Mode (GUI)
- From the **Tools menu**, select **Monitor Folder for Video**.
- Pick the folder to monitor.
- Pick an output folder.
- Set the time increment between checks.
- Click **Start Monitoring**.
- The app will monitor the folder from the system tray.
- Will pause automatically if you're doing manual transcription.

## ‚ö° Known Safety Features (Paranoid Additions)
- Files are checked for stability (not actively being written).
- Uses temp files and only moves to final output if successful.
- Handles file locks gracefully.
- Detects lost permissions (network paths, mapped drives).
- Runs retries with exponential backoff if failures happen.
- Warns you before overwriting existing files.

---

## üí° Notes
- This tool is over-engineered to avoid **half-finished files, race conditions, and permission errors**.
- All output and logs land in your Downloads folder by default.
- Works best on local drives but supports network shares with extra checks.
